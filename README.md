# 🏆 EL POLLO LOCO – An Object-Oriented Jump, Run & Throw Game  

**EL POLLO LOCO** is a fun and dynamic 2D platformer built as a practice project to explore **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts. In this game, you take control of **Pepe**, a brave character on a quest to collect coins and spicy Tabasco salsa to prepare for an epic battle against the **crazy hen**.  

## 🎮 About the Project  
This project was developed as a learning exercise to improve skills in **object-oriented design, game mechanics, and event-driven programming**. It focuses on core **OOP principles**, such as:  
- **Encapsulation**  
- **Inheritance**  
- **Polymorphism**  

These principles ensure a modular and maintainable game structure, making this project an excellent study case for game development enthusiasts.  

## 🔥 Game Features  
✔️ **Jump, Run & Throw Mechanics** – Move Pepe through the game world, avoid obstacles, and throw objects to defeat enemies.  
✔️ **Collectibles** – Gather coins and Tabasco salsa to power up for the final battle.  
✔️ **Enemy AI** – The crazy hen is not an easy opponent! Dodge her attacks and find the best strategy to win.  
✔️ **Object-Oriented Structure** – The game is designed using **classes and objects** to ensure flexibility and clean code.  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
- Understanding **OOP principles** in game development.  
- Implementing **game physics** (movement, collision detection, and interactions).  
- Structuring a game with **modular and reusable components**.  
- Handling **user input and event-driven mechanics**.  

## 🚀 Getting Started  
To run the game on your local machine:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sebastian-Rothe/EL-POLLO-LOCO-.git
